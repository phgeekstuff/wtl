The goal of the project is to build and maintain a high-level abstraction for C/C++ developers to take advantage of all modern standards of web, such as: HTTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SOAP and RESTFull web services, so on. Also, the idea is to provide tools for easy migration of legacy code and apps to web/connected environment.
